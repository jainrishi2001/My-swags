# My-swags
This is a project I am creating that will act as a journal as to all the swags and merch that I have collected in my college life.

## Introduction
The project is a basic one till now with only the front page created using basic HTML, CS and JS. I will be working on the backend now to define the paths and everything.

## Tech Stack:
This is a MERN Stack project which used Node JS, Express, EJS, Bootstrap, CSS3 and HTML. Will try implementing MongoDB as well soon.
